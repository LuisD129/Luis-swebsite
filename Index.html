<h2>Letter to future self
<p> Dear future Luis, Trust me bro college will be worth it, soon you'll have the information you need to be your own person. You'll learn so much and I hope you use that time wisely. I know through this time you will make mistakes and you'll have regrets, I mean everybody does, but don't let these mistakes from the past control your future.
